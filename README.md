# Basic-API-Call---chatgpt

This project is a basic ChatGPT interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create a simple chat UI that can interact with the OpenAI GPT API. The project includes two approaches:
- An inline script in `index.html` that calls the OpenAI API.
- An external `script.js` file that shows a dummy message response for testing.

## Features

- **Simple Chat Interface:** A user-friendly UI with a chat window, sidebar, and input box.
- **API Integration:** Example code to send user messages to the OpenAI GPT API (Chat Completion endpoint).
- **Dummy Response Implementation:** An alternative script (`script.js`) that appends a dummy bot response after a user sends a message.
- **Responsive Design:** Basic styling with CSS to provide a clean and responsive layout.

## File Structure

- **index.html:**  
  Contains the main HTML structure, inline JavaScript for API integration, and references to the CSS file.
- **script.js:**  
  Provides an alternative approach that simulates sending a message and receiving a dummy response.
- **styles.css:**  
  Contains styling rules for the chat UI.
